# dynamic_landing_page
Dynamic landing page project
Basic landing page using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, made with a tutorial video.
Saves the name and focus of the day for the user, while diaplaying the date and time.
Backaground image and greeting changes depending on times (morning, afternoon and evening).
Enjoyed this simple programme and helped me understand how the languages interact with each other.
